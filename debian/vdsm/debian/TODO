1. Add script in postinst and postrm to add/delete vdsm related kernel modules
from /etc/modules, as well as other cleanups.

2. Split the big single binary into sub-packages.

3. Fedora rtslib is actually rtslib-fb, it's incompatible with the official
rtslib. Ubuntu provides official rtslib through python-rtslib package, but
vdsm functional test need rtslib-fb. We have to split the tests to sub-package
and provide our own python-rtslib package based on rtslib-fb. Then the
developers can setup a dedicated environment to run functional tests. The users
do not need python-rtslib.

4. Setup a Jenkins slave for building VDSM deb package and run tests.
