Description: Dynamically manage system resources on virtualization hosts
 MOM is a policy-driven tool that can be used to manage overcommitment on KVM
 hosts. Using libvirt, MOM keeps track of active virtual machines on a host. At
 a regular collection interval, data is gathered about the host and guests. Data
 can come from multiple sources (eg. the /proc interface, libvirt API calls, a
 client program connected to a guest, etc). Once collected, the data is
 organized for use by the policy evaluation engine. When started, MOM accepts a
 user-supplied overcommitment policy. This policy is regularly evaluated using
 the latest collected data. In response to certain conditions, the policy may
 trigger reconfiguration of the systemâ€™s overcommitment mechanisms. Currently
 MOM supports control of memory ballooning and KSM but the architecture is
 designed to accommodate new mechanisms such as cgroups.
