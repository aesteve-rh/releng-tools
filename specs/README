This directory contains .spec files and build scripts for packages that
are needed by oVirt components but that aren't available in the
distributions that we support.

Each package has a subdirectory containing the template for the .spec
file (named .spec.in) and a build script (usually build.sh). The build
script should dowload the artifacts required for the build (usually only
the source code) and invoke the rpmbuild command to produce the .rpm
files in the same directory.

For example, to build the "httpcompones-core" RPM the sequence of
commands should be this one:

  $ git clone git://gerrit.ovirt.org/releng-tools.git
  $ cd specs
  $ cd httpcomponents-core
  $ ./build.sh

Note that the Java packages that require Maven to build expect to find
the "mvn" command in the path, so make sure to install it propertly
before trying to build. If your operating system doesn't include Maven
then you will need to dowload it from the Maven website, install it and
adjust your PATH environment variable so that the "mvn" command is in
the path.
